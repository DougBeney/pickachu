- [ ] Windows and Mac support 
- [ ] Add a :help menu for Pickachu
- [ ] Add tab-completion/suggestion for :Pick commands
- [ ] If the cursor is on a color value (hex or rgb/a), replace that color with the new one. Would also be cool if the color selected would open in the color picker.
- [ ] File picker should open in working directory by default

Notes:

- Windows/Mac support - This could be solved with Qarma. I need to decide if shipping Mac/Windows compiled binaries of Qarma is the best solution.
