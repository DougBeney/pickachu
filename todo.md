- [ ] File picker should open in working directory by default
- [ ] Color picker keyboard shortcut should work in insert mode
- [ ] If the cursor is on a color value (hex or rgb/a), replace that color with the new one. Would also be cool if the color selected would open in the color picker.
- [ ] Windows and Mac support
